This project involves creating a responsive landing page using HTML, SCSS (Sassy CSS) and the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.

## Features

- The landing page is completely responsive, ensuring it is accessible across mobile devices, tablets and desktops.
- Added a burger menu that appears upon button click. All links in this menu redirect to the desired sections of the page.
- Each button is entirely operational, enabling clicks on phone numbers, email addresses, and the address, which redirects to Google Maps.
- Interactive hover effects are implemented to enrich user engagement.
- Validation attributes are added to form fields to ensure accurate input, including specific types like email.
- Form submission clears fields without reloading the page, ensuring a seamless user journey.
- The footer stays anchored at the bottom of the page.
